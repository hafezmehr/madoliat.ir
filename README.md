# Madoliat.ir - Repository  
This repository hosts the personal homepage of **Dr. Madoliat**. You can view the homepage at [www.madoliat.ir](http://www.madoliat.ir).

## How to Edit the Website  
To modify the content of the website, follow these steps:

### Editing the Main Page (`index.html`)  
- The homepage of the website is stored in the `index.html` file located in the root directory of this repository.  
- You can edit this file directly using GitHubâ€™s online editor or by cloning the repository and making changes locally.  
- After making your edits, commit the changes using the green `Commit changes...` button to apply them.

### Adding Static Content (Images, Documents, Fonts, etc.)  
- Any static files, such as images, documents, or font files, should be placed inside the `static` folder.
- This helps keep the repository organized and ensures that all non-HTML resources are stored in a dedicated location.  

## How to Create a New Web Page (Custom Paths)  
If you want to add a new page to the website (for example, `madoliat.ir/courses`), follow these steps:  

1. **Create a New Folder**  
   - In the repository, create a new folder with the same name as the desired path.  
   - For instance, to create `madoliat.ir/courses`, you need to create a folder named `courses` in the root folder.  

2. **Add an `index.html` File**  
   - Inside the newly created folder, add an `index.html` file.
   - This file will serve as the webpage for the specified path (in this case `madoliat.ir/courses`).

3. **View the New Page**  
   - Once the changes are committed and published, the content inside the `index.html` file will be accessible at `madoliat.ir/courses`.

This structure allows you to easily expand the website by adding new sections without modifying the main `index.html` file.
